    "title": "About Me",
    "bio": "I'm a full-stack developer and current university instructor at SEU University. I teach programming and information systems courses, including Java, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and backend technologies. I've also led the design and launch of a startup platform that connected service providers with customers. Although the project eventually closed due to funding constraints, it taught me valuable lessons in team leadership, UI/UX design, and product development.",
    "currentFocus": "My PhD research focuses on detecting phishing and social engineering attacks using machine learning on multilingual datasets. I've developed a system that not only flags suspicious messages, but also explains the risks and educates users using AI-powered feedback.",

  "Research": {
    "title": "PhD Research Overview",
    "description": "My doctoral research focuses on combating phishing attacks using a human-centered AI model. The model is trained on large Arabic and English corpora and identifies not only whether a message is phishing but also explains why â€” offering real-time educational tips to users. The goal is to shift from binary detection to a learning-focused cybersecurity tool."
